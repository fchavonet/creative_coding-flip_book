# Flip Book

## Description

This project is a flip book created with HTML and CSS.

The design mimics the real-life experience of flipping through the pages of a book. Using CSS for page animations and transitions, the flip book provides a smooth experience for the user, making it both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

## Objectives

- All pages should flip smoothly using CSS animations.
- The project must be built using only HTML and CSS (initially, before adding JavaScript features).
- Improve CSS animation skills by creating realistic page effects.
- Provide clear and concise documentation for the code.
